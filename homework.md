						Python in Everyday Life

     I've been learning Python for 6 to 7 months now, and have really enjoyed it. Slowly but surely, I am finding ways 
to incorporate what I have learned in Python and other things such as Git, terminal usage, etc., into my every day life. 
The most recent example came when I was helping my daughter with her homework!

     My daughter had a homework assignment called “Magic Squares.” If you are not familiar with them, a Magic Square is 
typically a three by three grid (similar to Tic-Tac-Toe), in which each of the directional rows or columns (vertical, horizontal, 
and diagonal) all have the same sum. Due in part to the pandemic, she was assigned to do this in Google Classroom via a Google Slide. 
The slide was not well prepared, and it was very difficult to place her answers into the correct boxes.

     Me being me, I thought, “hey, this is a GREAT opportunity to use Python!” I thought about this in part because I had already made 
a Tic-Tac-Toe game in the past, and I already had a sample grid ready. All we had to do was populate it with the values from her homework 
assignment and then fill her answers into the empty squares. I was able to do this using some string manipulation, i.e. converting the strings
into lists to make changes and then back to strings again.

     Long story short, I ended up using my newfound knowledge of Python, Git, and terminal commands to quickly create a file for her, write 
to the file with her answers, and send it via email to her teacher. All of this was completed in about twenty to thirty minutes, and the 
majority of that time was spent fixing each grid to match the initial state of each problem that she had. This is a small example of the usefulness 
of Python in everyday life, but it has come in handy in other situations as well, such as having to parse a Rich Text File full of baby shower invitees 
for my wife.

     I love learning more about Python and developing/computer science in general, and I can honestly say that I would not know nearly as much 
as I currently do without the great Bites from Pybites. Thanks, Bob and Julian, for creating such a rich environment to learn in. Your expertise 
is greatly appreciated!

	 My name is Jesse. I'm an avid Pythonista trying to learn as much as I can about the language and programming in general. I first started
   learning to code about six or seven months ago. As quarantine started, I was looking for something new to learn, and boy, did I ever find it! 
   If I'm not coding, you can find me working, playing my guitar, or spending time with my family.
