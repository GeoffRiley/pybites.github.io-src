## Introduction

![Would you like to play a game?](images/guest-naughts-and-crosses-ai/like-to-play.png)[^WG]

If you happen to have recently hacked into [NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command)](https://www.norad.mil/)
then it is quite possible that you are stuck in the 1980s and are looking to play **Global Thermonuclear War**[^WG],
take it from me: it really won't turn out hope you hope.

On the other hand if you are looking for what is arguably the simplest of all strategy games, then you've come to the
right place. This article was inspired by the _PyBites Coding Challenge 12_—**Build a Tic-tac-toe Game**[^PCC12].

### Game concept

![Image of naughts and crosses grid](images/guest-naughts-and-crosses-ai/grid-blank.png)

Traditionally, naughts and crosses[^WP] is a pencil and paper game for two players: one playing the symbol 'O',
pronounced 'naught' or 'oh', and the other playing 'X', pronounced 'cross' or 'ex'. The game begins with a 3x3 grid of
nine cells, and the players take turns at drawing their symbols into one of the empty cells. The aim is to achieve the
occupation of three cells in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, with their own symbol, whilst _at the same
time_ interfering with their opponents attempts to do likewise. There are eight possible winning lines are shown in the
figure below.

## Basic game implementation

The first thing that is necessary in implementing _any_ game is deciding how it should be represented both to the player
and when it is held in the computer memory. We are working with fixed a three by three grid in this game, so it is easy
to see that a series of nine consecutive elements of an array can be used. Like this:

![Image of array of nine memory cells numbered zero to nine](images/guest-naughts-and-crosses-ai/memory-cells.png)

These memory cells, in turn, map to the three rows of three cells that will be displayed to the player. To help the
player to associate the positions of the cells, however, it is convenient to give a different _external_ mapping that is
based upon something familiar. A familiar three by three grid is found on the keyboard numeric keypad, but this is
'upside down' compared to how we have suggested the internal representation will be achieved.

This difference in representation can be handled in a few different ways:

* change the internal representation to match the external representation;
* change the external representation to match the internal representation; or
* find a way to translate between the two representations as and when needed.

There are implications for each of these options. Firstly, if the internal representation is changed, it wil be
necessary to extract the details for the grid when it is being displayed in a non-sequential order. This is not an
impossible situation, but adds a layer of complexity that is probably undesirable. Secondly, if the external
representation is changed, then it inconveniences the player who will have to think more about the value of the cell
rather than the position. Thirdly, and finally, translating between the two systems allows the positives of both
representations to be exercised with a minor inconvenience of ensuring that the interface between the two sides is
patrolled appropriately.

Assuming that the third option is taken we have the following representations:

### Starting the code

It is always wise to start off a Python file with a descriptive comment about the file, who wrote it, any copyright
declarations, the place within a project that it belongs and what the weather is like when you write the code, possibly
less likely on that last one. So, we begin our project and, as it is going to be a single file, just comment on what the
whole project is about. If this was to be a one of a number of files then the description would focus upon the
functionality of this particular file.

```python
"""
    Proper name: 'Naughts and Crosses'
    Irish name: 'Xs and Os'
    American name: 'Tic Tac Toe'
    Reason: Who on Earth has a clue?  It's an historical thing.
"""
```

Lovely. That'll do nicely. Not much coding going on there though. There are going to be some `import`s of various
modules to help us with the coding, straight off the bat we know that we are going to be dealing with some kind of
memory cells, this brings to mind that we'll need coding hints for things like `List` and perhaps `Union` so we'll add
those in for a starter. Later on we'll add more in at this place in the file.

```python
from typing import List, Union
```

There are a number of elements of the game that can be usefully given names to help to document the code as we go along.
The extra advantage to defining things by name at this point is that if we want to change things later on, then any
changes made here automatically reflect through the whole code. (Hurrah!)

So, what elements need to be defined? We have already identified that there are internal and external representations
involved, therefore those should be defined along with the mapping between the two. Externally we know that we're going
to have 'O' and 'X' to show the symbols—that much is obvious—but there is a third symbol too: the blank. The blank could
be just a space character, but that isn't very _visible_ if you want to **see** the grid, particular when it is empty,
but also when working out which row and column a single symbol might be on. For this reason we'll use the
underscore ('_') to represent a blank space.

```python
# External representations of the playing symbols 
BLANK_SYM: str = '_'
O_SYM: str = 'O'
X_SYM: str = 'X'
```

That will make any grids clear:

```text
 ___     _X_     ___
 ___     ___     _O_
 ___     ___     ___
Blank / One X / One O
```

What about internal representations? Does it matter? We could use the same symbols, however we _do_ know that string
comparisons are slower than integer comparisons, and so it would probably be better to use the quicker of the two given
that there are a lot of comparisons that will be made. Let us keep it simple and just use the values zero to two.

```python
# Internal representations of the playing symbols 
BLANK_VALUE: int = 0
O_VALUE: int = 1
X_VALUE: int = 2
```

Now that we have those defined, we can create a couple of dictionaries that map between the two systems:

```python
# Translation between systems
VAL_TO_SYM: dict = {
    BLANK_VALUE: BLANK_SYM,
    O_VALUE: O_SYM,
    X_VALUE: X_SYM,
}
SYM_TO_VAL: dict = {
    BLANK_SYM: BLANK_VALUE,
    O_SYM: O_VALUE,
    X_SYM: X_VALUE,
}
```

The chances are that whilst we are going through checking for winning lines and such like, we might want a quick way to
refer to the opponent of the current player; we might not need it, but it could prove useful:

```python
OPPONENT: dict = {
    O_VALUE: X_VALUE,
    X_VALUE: O_VALUE,
}
```

Just a couple of other things that need to be taken care of: the translation of internal to external grid positions, and
vise versa. Looking at the graphical images of the two representations, it is easy to write out a couple of dictionary
constants mapping between the two:

![Image of internal and external representations of grid](images/guest-naughts-and-crosses-ai/numbering-int-and-ext.png)

```python
INTERNAL_TO_EXTERNAL: dict = {
    0: 7, 1: 8, 2: 9,
    3: 4, 4: 5, 5: 6,
    6: 1, 7: 2, 8: 3
}
EXTERNAL_TO_INTERNAL: dict = {
    7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 2,
    4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 5,
    1: 6, 2: 7, 3: 8
}
```

In order to help validate the player input we'll create a list of valid positions for their pieces, remember that
`range()` returns value that _includes_ the first parameter, but _excludes_ the second parameter:

```python
VALID_POSITIONS: Set[int] = set(range(1, 10))
```

I originally created this as a `list` but realised later that it was better (essentially more efficient) as a `set` so
it is necessary to add `Set` to the `from typing import` line

Oh, and of course we need a list of winning combinations so that it is quick to check. It is convenient to specify a
winning line as a tuple of three integers, so here we have a list of (tuples of (three integers)): ah, `Tuple`, that's
another item to import from the `typing` module. The winning lines are describing the _internal_ numbering as per this
diagram:

![Image of winning combination in same order as defined array](images/guest-naughts-and-crosses-ai/winning-positions.png)
![Image of internal numbering](images/guest-naughts-and-crosses-ai/numbering-internal.png)

```python
# A winning combination exists for three symbols in a row:
WINNING_COMBINATIONS: List[Tuple[int, int, int]] = [
    (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8),
    (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8),
    (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6),
]
```

### The main class

Class. Yes, this game is going to be encompassed within an object!  We can start getting into the nitty gritty right off
by declaring our class… in deference to our US cousins we'll call our class `TicTacToe`—it's both shorter than
`NaughtsAndCrosses` and less likely to cause argument over 'Nau…' versus 'Nou…'[^Naught].

At the start of the class we'll define a few variables that are going to be useful throughout the game code, and define
the types that we're expecting them to hold:

```python
class TicTacToe:
    # define the types of various internal variables
    _board: List[int]
    _turn: int
    _turn_cycle: Iterator[int]
    _move: int
```

Going through these:

* `_board`: this will hold the current _internal_ representation of the playing area;
* `_turn`: keeping track of whose turn it is will be very necessary, this should only ever be `O_VALUE` or `X_VALUE`;
* `_turn_cycle`: a useful iterator object that returns an endless sequence of `O_VALUE`, `X_VALUE`, `O_VALUE`,
  `X_VALUE`, and so on; and
* `_move`: a count of the number of moves taken. There are nine spaces and so there is a maximum of nine moves.

As we're adding yet another type hint here, it's probably best to make sure that our import statement has caught up with
all the various additions:

```python
from typing import List, Union, Set, Tuple, Iterator
```

Hopefully that's got all our typing needs covered now.

An important part of every class in the `__init__()` initializer method, or _Constructor_, that is used to set up the
blank object:

```python
    def __init__(self):
    """Constructor, allocate the blank board"""
    # Create an array of cells to hold the grid positions.
    self._board = [BLANK_VALUE] * len(VALID_POSITIONS)
    self._turn_cycle = cycle([O_VALUE, X_VALUE])
    self._turn = self._next_turn()
    self._move = 0
```

A little bit of explanation may be useful here, the `_board` is set by the curious construction above: multiplying a
single element list by the length of a set?? In this case the `*` does not literally indicate mathematical
multiplication, but rather duplication: it indicates that the list element is to be repeated. As an example here is a
sort console log showing the use of the functionality:

```text
Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 07:30:14) 
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux
In[2]: f = [1]
In[3]: f
Out[3]: [1]
In[4]: f * 8
Out[4]: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This is a simple method of creating a list containing a repeated element, however, it should be noted that it is not
good for very large lists due to the requirement of core memory in making the list. We know that in this case the length
of the `VALID_POSITIONS` set is only nine so there is no worry about excessive memory use.

The `_turn_cycle` variable is created with a very useful element of the `itertools` module. `cycle` creates a repeating
iterator from the provided iterable parameter. Here we are passing a two element list, consisting of the two player
options, and in return we get an object that will respond to the `next()` method by returning each element in turn, when
the list is exhausted it automatically starts at the beginning again.[^Cycle] Our imports do not currently include the
itertools module, so we need to add the extra import line at the top of the file:

```python
from itertools import cycle
```

Looking back at the `__init__()` method it can be seen that `_turn` is initialised by the return value of another
method, `_next_turn()`. It is possibly easy to guess what this method does, but let's sketch it in now to be sure:
```python
    def _next_turn(self) -> int:
        return next(self._turn_cycle)
```
Yes, we're using the `_turn_cycle` variable to pick off the next player; this is why it was necessary to assign 
`_turn_cycle` before `_turn` in the `__init__()` method.  It might seem a little odd to have a 'private' method that 
just returns the value from a private iterator, but there are two reasons for doing this:
1. it ensures that the syntax for `next(self._turn_cycle)` is consistantly followed; and, more importantly
2. it allows for additional functionality to be performed when the next turn is being selected without having to seek
    out every instance of the operation.

Arguably one of the most important elements of the object is to provide a visible version of the board layout, remember
that our internal representation follows for directly printing out in three rows so there is no need to manipulate
the order before generating the output:
```python
    def __str__(self):
        """Print the board"""
        return '\n'.join(
            ' '.join(
                VAL_TO_SYM[c]
                for c in self._board[s * 3:(s + 1) * 3]
            ) for s in range(3)
        )
```
This looks a little complex because it is using multiply nested `str.join()` statements. It may become clearer if we
unwind it into a longer version:
```python
    def __str__(self):
        """Alternative view of same function"""
        output = []
        for s in range(3):
            row = []
            for t in range(3):
                c = self._board[s*3 + t]
                row.append(VAL_TO_SYM[c])
            output.append(' '.join(row))
        return '\n'.join(output)
```
The use of `VAL_TO_SYM` translates the internal values to the external symbols.
