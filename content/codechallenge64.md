Hey Pythonistas,

This weekend is Pycon ES and in the unlikely event you get bored, you can always do some coding with PyBites. Two more good reasons to do so:

1. there are prizes / giveaways,
2. your PRs count towards [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) (t-shirt). Fire up your editors and let's get coding!

## The Challenge

Most of this challenge is open-ended. We really want to give you creative powers. Here is what we are going to do:

1. Create an account on [https://developer.marvel.com](https://developer.marvel.com). Upon confirming your email you should get an API key.

2. Write code to successfully make requests to the API, check out [the docs](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/authorization) (_Authentication for Server-Side Applications_ section).

3. To be good citizens make a function to cache the data to avoid repeated queries while working with the data. To respect the API's rate limits you probably want to focus on just [one or a few endpoints](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) ( _characters_, _comics_, _creators_, _events_, _series_, or _stories_). We [provided a template](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/community/64/marvel.py) with some hints to get started. Save the (JSON) data from the API locally and start analyzing ...

4. Now the fun part; here we let you be totally free: look through the data and tell us / our community a story. Make stunning data visualizations of your collected data and share them on [our Slack](https://pybit.es/pages/community.html), in the #marvel channel.

5. [PR your work on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/64/) **before Friday 11th of Oct. 2019 23.59 [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)** (again remember, this also adds up for that [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) t-shirt!). The 3 best submissions win one of our prizes:

	- a one year subscription to [our 220+ Bites of Py exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/)

	- a copy of our [100 days of Web course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_web/100-days-of-web-in-python)

	- a 75 USD Amazon.com Gift Card to spend on (Python) books

	- each winner also gets a copy of our [Newbie bites](https://codechalleng.es/bites/newbie) to give away to a friend who wants to learn Python ...
