The PyBites Developer Mindset Program has given me confidence and clarity in direction and allowed me to make life changing decisions regarding my career.

Julian and Bob helped me see that I was underappreciated in my job and was wasting my time there.

In a relatively short period of time I gained the Python and leadership skills, self-awareness and confidence I needed to become a successful Python developer / data scientist in an Energy Startup.

I was at the point when I did not want to continue to do coding. I was faced with a choice: to stay on the same level and go slow or to get started on bigger project I always wanted to build.

I decided to do something bigger, but I did not know how to carry out the large parts of that project technically.

The PyBites Developer Mindset Program helped me push my experience to collaborate, choose the right custom framework and formulate my project draft using real software design principles.

Julian and Bob not only guided me on what I needed to know but, as an unexpected bonus, taught me the skills and mindset I needed to be confident in myself and my coding ability.

The improvements to my Python and newfound self-confidence made in just a few weeks would have undoubtedly taken me 10 years to achieve without the coaching in this program.

Bob and Julian have each given me valuable one-on-one attention and advice. Bob has carefully reviewed the most important items in my portfolio, and helped me to upgrade them significantly. Julian has guided me towards important resources that are letting me make full use of my natural abilities.

The PyBites Developer Mindset Program has leveled up my programming skills, increased my value to employers, and raised my own expectations of myself.

I am now well prepared to re-enter the technological workforce after a long absence.
