Over the last few years of growing our PyBites Community we've produced amazing results for our clients.

We've tackled common pitfalls like tutorial paralysis, improper sequencing and staying comfortable, which won't get you anywhere.

And now, after many iterations, we have our unique system which creates rockstar Python developers.

> I recently interviewed for this Data Engineer position. I was able to answer questions during their technical phone screening that I otherwise wouldn’t have known because I kept up with the bites. I ended up getting an offer and I start next Monday! - Marin M.

> We set up a go grpc server and created a Python client for it today. Thanks to the web dev knowledge I learned with you in the last weeks, I knew all important things and was able to discuss API design etc. with the other backend dev 👌 Thanks again for the PyBites Developer Mindest Program 🙏 - Robin B

However coding is just one part of the equation and often the "easier" bit to learn.

In order to grow your career you need to also be strategic, build up relevant portfolio assets, drop perfectionism and develop confidence in your abilities.

> I feel like I had a big win with confidence today. Today I reached out to the biggest python groups on Facebook to promote my message. Bob and Julian' s mentorship kicked my ass into gear and proved to me that my skills are ready to showcase to the world. Thanks Bob and Julian. - Ben M.

We deeply care about helping other people succeed in their careers using Python and leadership skills. If you care about being the best Python developer you can be and want to boost your career, congratulations. You're in the right place.

Bob studied business economics, but <a href="http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2019/12/02/pydev-of-the-week-bob-belderbos/" target="_blank">got fired up about programming</a> early in his career.

He taught himself web design / coding and started living his biggest passion: automate the boring stuff, making other people's lives easier.

Since then he has coded <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/jobsatoracle/bob-belderbos-career-success-story:-leveraging-your-brand-and-network-to-achieve-career-aspirations" target="_blank">projects accruing millions in cost savings</a> and built a coding platform that has taught Python to thousands of people worldwide.

He deeply cares about helping other people succeed. His biggest win will be your next win!

With a background in Servers and Data Centers at 3 of the largest companies on the planet, Julian made the challenging switch to a Python software developer role in 2019.

After learning Python teaching it on <a href="https://pybit.es" target="_blank">PyBites</a> with best friend Bob, Julian has made it his mission to spread not only his love of Python but also his expertise in communication and mindset.

His infectious enthusiasm, motivation and ability to energise those around him greatly assist him in his role of mentoring aspiring Python developers keen on growing their careers.
