Title: 100 Days Of Code
status: hidden
Slug: 100days

### Write Code

We are 100 Days of Code survivors. Even better: what started as an innocent little project morphed into a complete product line.

It all started hitting 100 days of our blog and we thought: [let's celebrate with a challenge](https://pybit.es/special-100days.html).

We made it and 100 days later we reflected and [had built up quite a code base](https://pybit.es/special-100days-of-code.html) ([repo](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode) - 378 stars and counting, not too shabby).

### Get Noticed

This did not go unnoticed: we were honored to talk about it [on Episode 140 of Talk Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/140/level-up-your-python-with-100daysofcode-challenge).

### Opportunity

This led to partnering up with Mike producing the [#100DaysOfCode in Python](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_in_python/100-days-of-code-in-python) and its sequel the [#100DaysOfWeb in Python](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_web/100-days-of-web-in-python) (featured on [Episode 224 of Talk Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/224/12-lessons-from-100-days-of-web)).
